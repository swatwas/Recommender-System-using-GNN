This project contains my exploration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), including notes and code implementation.
My project is a recommender system using GNNs and PyTorch, specifically the LightGCN model with a self-supervised task.
This project implements a LightGCN-based recommender system using PyTorch. The goal is to build a recommendation engine that can predict user-item interactions based on a bipartite graph structure, 
where users and items are treated as nodes, and interactions are edges.
LightGCN Implementation: A graph-based recommendation model that removes non-linear activations and focuses on simpler propagation mechanisms.
Self-Supervised Learning Task: Adds a self-supervised task to improve the recommendation performance.
